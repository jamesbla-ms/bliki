# The myth of agile in my life

This is not about agile software development. Rather, it's about the limitations of agile in the types of projects I work on; at least the limitations that exist once I get involved anyway.

The reality of things is this:

- There is a contract that exists
- Regardless of what the contract **says**, the customer that signed the contract went through a pre-sales process where there was:
  - A general understanding of what was going to get done
  - A rough sense of what it would cost to do it
  - A loose timeline for how long it would take

It's useful to define your terms, for me agile always means the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). Here is the text of it:

>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
>- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>- Working software over comprehensive documentation
>- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>- Responding to change over following a plan
>
>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

First day of the project and our ship of agile is on the rocks. There is a signed contract and a plan in place. We have more tools and processes then any one person can master.

It's tempting to try and wave these things away and think that once you get things rolling you'll be able to renegotiate some of the working agreements and get things on a more agile footing. This has happened a couple times on my past projects, so it isn't impossible. The prerequisite for that has always been that we are working with an organization that has already embraced an agile mindset.

The more typical situation is that there is some elasticity to the working agreements but they eventually snap back to the customer's original understanding of what they thought they were going to get, when, and for how much. That shift can happen almost instantaneously if there are problems during delivery.

We aren't delivering in an agile frame the vast majority of the time. We have to keep in mind that a lot of things are not nearly as negotiable as they would need to be for us to "do agile" as envisioned by petabytes of blog posts and books. That doesn't mean we can't do agile things or take agile approaches to problems. **We can! We should!** The agile mindset the manifesto advocates is still really valuable and helps us.

This isn't an inherently bad situation. It's actually fine and success isn't less likely. If anything, we're more likely to be successful if we accept the frame that we are actually delivering in. Commitments have been made; embrace them and plan (loosely) on how to meet them. If we can't, it's not the end of the world. It happens all the time. There are solutions and they'll probably be identified and adopted using an agile approach to the problems. The key is to unearth the surprises as early as humanly possible.
