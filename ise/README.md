# Overview

The Microsoft Industry Solutions Engineering group works in partnership with customers to solve problems. They have a fairly opinionated process for how they run their projects which they have documented [here](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/).

I'm grateful to them for having published this publicly, as I have found their documentation to be incredibly valuable. This value is not necessarily their opinions, it's that they have generated a pretty thorough list of things that project teams and organizations should think through and develop their own opinions on.

## Things that get documented

These two documents in particular are a nice idea. If we look at the guidance for completing these, there are ton of really good ideas here for teams to think about and make decisions about:

- Team Manifesto
- Working Agreement

On the other end, these two wind up being a little overrated for me. It just seems like we create these project after project and they quickly get ignored by everyone. If I think back, this didn't really impact success or failure. It's important that the work items are well written, but what that means can be different from work item to work item and I think that's fine.

- Definition of Ready
- Definition of Done

## Miscellaneous Opinions

### Story points

Story points are used to establish the velocity of a team. You need a largish sample size to have this velocity have actual predictive value. If the project isn't going to run for double digit sprints and feature stable team structures, the usefulness of story points goes down really fast.

#### Story points are not hours

If we could do math and convert story points to hours, what would the point of story points be? We would just use hours. Story points were created to do something different; they incorporate uncertainty and risk into the process of estimation. Story points are not hours.

#### Story point values for a given work item are overrated

Is a story 3 points or 5? Doesn't matter, pick one and move on.
