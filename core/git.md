# Git and what does it mean to be proficient

Git is the defacto source control standard for building software nowadays. It is also somewhat famous for being opaque and confusing to use until you are really comfortable with it. It was built by software engineers for other software engineers, so naturally it features 20 switches for every command and at least 3 ways to get to a similar result for everything you want to do. Oh, and regex.

The fact that it's complex doesn't change the reality that it has become the defacto standard. In fact, the complexity is the reason it's so widely used. All that complexity is granting you tremendous power to do some pretty amazing things, providing you know how it works. Therefore, proficiency with Git is simply a requirement. What does it mean to be proficient with Git?

Short answer: using Git from the commandline.

## What about the visual tooling?

All the visual tooling suffers from two key problems:

- It obscures a huge percentage of the functionality of Git. Powerful functionality which is the whole reason we want to use Git in the first place.
- It obscures the commands it is using to do stuff. If you get into a problem and need to drop to the commandline to fix it, you don't know what commands the visual tooling actually issued, so it's much harder to unwind a mess.

The one thing the visual tooling is very good at is visualizing things. If you are reading your repository trying to figure something out, the visual tooling is fantastic. If you are writing to your repository, you should always use the commandline.

## Proficiency, the long answer

I believe everyone should feel comfortable doing all of the following things in Git. We're not talking about doing it all from memory, that's crazy. I mean understanding what all of the items in this list are for and being comfortable doing them with the help of the documentation, blogs, whatever.

- Installation and configuration
- The difference between the working directory, the staging area, and the repository
- Tracking and untracking files
- Deleting and moving files
- Creating a commit
- Amending commits
- Keeping track of, creating, and deleting branches
- Merging  and rebasing branches
- Interactive rebasing within a branch
- Dealing with conflicts
- A fundamental understanding of how Git works under the covers. For example, what are all these hashes?
- Working with GitHub integration
- Working with Azure DevOps integration

If any of this is unfamiliar, good news! You have an opportunity to learn some new things and become proficient in Git!
