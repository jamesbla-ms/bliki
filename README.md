# I'm writing down what I think I know

I've been involved in building custom solutions for Microsoft Services since 2007. This is what I think I've learned in the process.

I'm calling this a bliki after Martin Fowler's work. This is supposed to be the same sort of thing, a personal online notebook for me to put thoughts down.
Some of this may be incompletely explored or highly subjective. I reserve the right to completely change my mind about anything I write here, it's just me
figuring things out.

Finally, this is just me thinking. I'm not speaking for Microsoft here.
